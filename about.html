        <div class="about-intro">
          <p class="about-lead">We believe that beautiful things deserve a second life. Every piece in our collection has been hand-selected for its character, craftsmanship and quiet beauty.</p>

            <h3 class="about-heading">OUR PHILOSOPHY</h3>
            <p>Chapter Two was founded on the simple idea that antiques and vintage pieces bring a warmth, texture and soul to a home that new furniture simply cannot replicate. We source from estates, auctions and private collections across the UK and Europe, always looking for pieces with genuine character and honest patina.</p>
            <p>We don't restore to perfection. We believe the marks of age, the worn edges and the faded finishes are what make each piece unique. Every scratch tells a story. Every repair speaks of a life well lived.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="about-section">
            <h3 class="about-heading">WHAT WE LOOK FOR</h3>
            <p>Our collection spans the 17th to early 20th centuries, with a focus on:</p>
            <ul class="about-list">
              <li>Country house and farmhouse furniture</li>
              <li>French and English provincial pieces</li>
              <li>Decorative mirrors and lighting</li>
              <li>Architectural salvage and curiosities</li>
              <li>Garden antiques and outdoor furniture</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We favour pieces that work in modern interiors -- items that can sit alongside contemporary design and bring depth and interest to a room.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="about-section">
            <h3 class="about-heading">HOW WE WORK</h3>
            <p>Each item is photographed in situ to help you visualise how it might look in your own home. We provide honest, detailed descriptions including condition, provenance and dimensions.</p>
            <p>We also offer a sourcing service for clients looking for something specific. If you have a particular piece in mind, we'd love to help you find it.</p>
          </div>
